## FEATURE:

[Describe what you want to build — be specific about functionality, end state, and user-visible behavior.
Bad:  "Build an API"
Good: "Build a REST API with /users endpoint that supports CRUD operations, JWT auth, and returns paginated JSON responses"]

## EXAMPLES:

[Point to example code that AI should follow as reference.
- If you have examples in an examples/ folder, list them here and explain what aspect to follow.
- If you have no examples yet, describe the patterns you want the AI to mimic.
- You can also reference external repos or documentation.]

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List any documentation that the AI needs to reference during implementation.
- Official library/framework docs (URLs)
- API documentation for external services
- Internal design docs or specs
- MCP server documentation if applicable]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Anything else the AI should know:
- Common pitfalls you've seen AI assistants make
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Specific libraries to use or avoid
- Environment setup notes]
