### Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
[VIRTUAL_ENV_INSTRUCTION — e.g., "Use venv/ for Python commands" or remove if not applicable]

### Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
[MODULE_STRUCTURE — describe the module pattern for this project's tech stack, e.g.:
  For Python: agent.py, tools.py, prompts.py
  For TypeScript: controller.ts, service.ts, types.ts
  For Go: handler.go, service.go, model.go]
- **Use clear, consistent imports** ([IMPORT_STYLE — e.g., "prefer relative imports within packages" or "use path aliases like @/"]).
[ENV_MANAGEMENT — e.g., "Use python-dotenv and load_dotenv()" or "Use dotenv with process.env"]

### Testing & Reliability
- **Always create [TEST_FRAMEWORK] tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.

### Style & Conventions
- **Use [PRIMARY_LANGUAGE]** as the primary language.
[STYLE_RULES — e.g.:
  - "Follow PEP8, use type hints, and format with black."
  - "Follow Airbnb style guide, use TypeScript strict mode."
  - "Use gofmt and follow Go conventions."]
[VALIDATION_LIBRARY — e.g., "Use pydantic for data validation" or "Use zod for schema validation"]
[FRAMEWORK_CONVENTIONS — e.g., "Use FastAPI for APIs" or "Use Next.js App Router"]
[DOCSTRING_STYLE — describe the expected documentation format for functions, e.g.:
  ```
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```
  or JSDoc, or GoDoc, etc.]

### Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** — only use known, verified packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
