## FEATURE:

[Describe what you want to build — be specific about functionality, end state, and user-visible behavior.
Bad:  "Add search"
Good: "Add full-text search to the /products endpoint using PostgreSQL tsvector, with support for filtering by category and sorting by relevance"]

## EXAMPLES:

[Point to existing code in this project that the AI should follow as reference.
- Which existing feature is most similar to what you're building?
- Which files demonstrate the patterns to follow?
- Example: "Follow the same pattern as src/features/users/ for route, service, and model structure"]

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List any documentation that the AI needs to reference during implementation.
- Official library/framework docs (URLs)
- API documentation for external services
- Internal design docs or specs]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Anything else the AI should know:
- How does this feature interact with existing features?
- Are there database migrations needed?
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Known constraints from the existing codebase]
