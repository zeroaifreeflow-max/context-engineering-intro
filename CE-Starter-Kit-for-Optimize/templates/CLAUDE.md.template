### Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
[VIRTUAL_ENV_INSTRUCTION — detected from project, e.g., "Activate venv/ before running Python" or remove if not applicable]

### Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Follow the existing module pattern:**
[DETECTED_MODULE_PATTERN — describe the pattern found in the codebase, e.g.:
  "Features are organized as: routes/ → services/ → models/ (see src/features/users/ for reference)"
  "Each module has: agent.py, tools.py, prompts.py (see agents/research_agent/ for reference)"]
- **Use [DETECTED_IMPORT_STYLE]** for imports (e.g., "absolute imports with @ alias" or "relative imports within packages").
[DETECTED_ENV_MANAGEMENT — e.g., "Use python-dotenv with load_dotenv()" or "Access via process.env"]

### Testing & Reliability
- **Use [DETECTED_TEST_FRAMEWORK]** for all tests.
- **Follow the existing test pattern** seen in [REFERENCE_TEST_FILE — actual path to a representative test file].
- **Tests live in `[DETECTED_TEST_DIR]/`** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing tests need to be updated. If so, do it.

### Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.

### Style & Conventions
[DETECTED_STYLE_RULES — generate from what was actually found in the codebase, e.g.:
- "Use TypeScript strict mode with no `any` types"
- "Follow PEP8 with type hints, format with black"
- "Use gofmt, keep functions under 50 lines"]
[DETECTED_NAMING — e.g.:
- "Files: kebab-case (user-service.ts)"
- "Functions: camelCase"
- "Classes: PascalCase"
- "Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE"]
[DETECTED_DOCSTRING_STYLE — show the actual pattern found in the codebase with an example from a real file]

### Existing Patterns to Follow
[CRITICAL_PATTERNS — list 3-5 key patterns with file references, e.g.:
- "API route pattern: see `src/api/routes/users.py` for the standard approach"
- "Database query pattern: see `src/repositories/userRepo.ts` for how we wrap queries"
- "Error handling: we use custom AppError class from `src/utils/errors.ts`"]

### Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** — only use known, verified packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **Follow existing patterns** — when adding new code, match the style and structure of the closest existing feature.
